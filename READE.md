## Features
- **Task Creation:** Users can add new tasks with details such as name, description, state, creation date, creator, and category.
- **Task Viewing:** Tasks can be viewed with filters based on name, description, and category.
- **Task Updating:** Users can mark tasks as done directly from the task list.
- **Task Deletion:** Tasks can be deleted individually.
- **Task Filtering:** Tasks can be filtered by category or searched through a text input on the sidebar.

## How It Works
The app uses SQLite for data storage, providing persistent storage of tasks. Pydantic models are utilized to ensure data integrity and validation. Streamlit's interactive components make it easy to interact with the app and perform CRUD operations on tasks.

## Future Development
- **User Authentication:** Implement user authentication to allow multiple users to manage their tasks securely.
- **Task Editing:** Add the ability to edit existing tasks.
- **Improved Filtering:** Enhance filtering capabilities to include date ranges and state.
- **Mobile Responsiveness:** Improve the UI for better usability on mobile devices.
- **Cloud Database Integration:** Migrate from SQLite to a cloud database for better scalability and remote access.
